In this example, we establish whether a type inherits from a sealed trait. To do so, we first obtain the list of all the parents of the given type. Then, we see if any of the parents has the `Sealed` flag.

To obtain the list of all the parents, we utilize the TASTy Reflect `Type` API. We first obtain a `tasty.Type` via calling `unseal` (gives us a `tasty.TypeTree`) and then `tpe` (gives us `tasty.Type`) on the `quoted.Type`. We then call `baseClasses` defined in the API of `tasty.Type` which gives us a `List[Symbol]` with all the parents of the given type.

Given a `Symbol`, we can use the `Symbol` API to check if it has a given flag. The flag of interest for us is `Sealed` as all the sealed traits carry it. We can check whether a symbol has a flag via `sym.flags.is(flagInQuestion)` idiom. We use this idiom to see if any of the parents has the `Sealed` flag.
